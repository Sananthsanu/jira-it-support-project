# IT Support Ticketing System – Jira Project Report

## 1. Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world IT Support environment using **Jira Service Management**. The goal was to practice incident handling, service requests, internal tasks, and support queries by following standard ITIL-aligned workflows.

## 2. Objectives

* Simulate real IT support incidents and requests
* Practice Jira ticket lifecycle management
* Apply prioritization and SLA awareness
* Document investigation, resolution, and verification steps
* Prepare resume-ready evidence with screenshots

## 3. Tools & Environment

* **Tool:** Jira Service Management (Cloud – Free Tier)
* **Project:** Sananth IT Team
* **Workflow States:** To Do → In Progress → Waiting for Customer → Resolved

## 4. Ticket Types Used

* **Incident:** System outages and failures
* **Service Request:** User access and software installation
* **Task:** Internal IT operational work
* **Support:** User guidance and how-to assistance

## 5. Sample Tickets Implemented

### Critical Incidents

* Production database server down – users unable to access application
* Email server not responding – users unable to send or receive emails

### High/Medium Incidents

* Disk space full on Linux server causing application issues
* User unable to login after password reset

### Service Requests

* New employee system access request
* Request to install VS Code on user workstation

### Tasks & Support

* Restart Linux application service
* How to connect to VPN – user guidance required

## 6. Incident Handling Workflow (Example)

**Email Server Outage**

1. Ticket created with Highest priority and flagged as Impediment
2. Status moved to *In Progress* with investigation comments
3. Email service restored and verification requested (*Waiting for Customer*)
4. User confirmation documented
5. Ticket marked *Resolved*

## 7. Task Handling Workflow (Example)

**Restart Linux Application Service**

1. Task moved to *In Progress*
2. Service restarted and verified
3. Task marked *Resolved* (no customer waiting required)

## 8. Key Learnings

* Proper use of Jira workflows and statuses
* Difference between Incident, Service Request, Task, and Support
* Importance of documentation and user communication
* SLA-based prioritization and escalation

## 9. Outcome

* Multiple realistic tickets created and resolved
* End-to-end workflow demonstrated using Jira boards
* Screenshots captured for dashboard, ticket lifecycle, and resolutions

## 10. Resume Summary

Simulated IT Support operations using Jira Service Management by handling incidents, service requests, tasks, and support tickets with proper prioritization, documentation, and resolution workflows.
